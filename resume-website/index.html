						<p>Welcome to my personal website! I am Rithwik Gokhale, a software engineer with a passion for technology and innovation. Here, you can explore my journey, projects, and achievements.</p>
					</div>
					<p>I'm a Computer Engineering grad with a Data Science minor from Iowa State University, working at the crossroads of technology, analytics, and practical problem-solving. I enjoy turning complexity into clarity—whether that's through building smart systems, improving processes, or aligning tech solutions with business goals.</p>
					
					<p>At Adatafy, I wear multiple hats across software engineering and technical product ownership. I lead digital transformation projects for clients in pharma, biofuels, and agriculture—taking them from initial scoping and stakeholder alignment all the way to deployment and adoption. My work involves close collaboration with cross-functional teams, hands-on development in Python and C#, and using tools like Tableau and MES systems to build solutions that improve efficiency, traceability, and operational insight.</p>
					
					<p>Beyond coding, I regularly manage roadmapping discussions, lead project update meetings, gather feedback from end users, and help translate technical constraints into product decisions—skills that sit at the heart of technical product and program management.</p>
					
					<p>In previous roles at Nvidia and Dolby, I worked on product strategy, XR prototyping, and enterprise project management. At Nvidia, I developed AR/VR prototypes for CloudXR, supported roadmap planning, and coordinated with internal and external stakeholders to demonstrate use cases in medical training. At Dolby, I applied Agile frameworks to improve cross-departmental collaboration and delivery efficiency.</p>
					
					<p>I'm passionate about building tech that works for people—solutions that are not just functional, but intuitive, scalable, and aligned with the bigger picture. Always open to learning from others, sharing ideas, and exploring how we can drive impact through innovation.</p>

						<h3>Building Persona-Driven Demo Systems for Industrial Platforms</h3>
						<p class="blog-meta">August 2025</p>
						
						<p>Selling complex industrial software is less about showing every feature and more about solving real problems for specific people. Over the past year at Adatafy, I built demo environments for three platforms (Shiftconnector, Augmentir, and GoCanvas) that our sales team now uses every week. Here is how I approached each one from the viewpoint of key personas, the features I chose to highlight, and why the demos land in day to day operations.</p>

						<h4>1. Understanding Each Platform's Strengths</h4>

						<h5>Shiftconnector (MES System)</h5>
						<p><strong>Focus:</strong> real-time shop-floor visibility, automated workflows, data capture for compliance.</p>
						<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Workflow module that enforces standard operating procedures (SOPs)</li>
							<li>Real-time dashboards for OEE, quality, and throughput metrics</li>
							<li>Integration with PLCs and sensors for automated data ingestion</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Augmentir (Digital Workflows + Guided Procedures)</h5>
						<p><strong>Focus:</strong> guided work instructions, skill-based routing, remote assistance.</p>
						<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Step-by-step guided procedures with embedded videos and AR annotations</li>
							<li>Skill-based work assignment that routes tasks to qualified technicians</li>
							<li>Built-in feedback loops to capture field-level improvement suggestions</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>GoCanvas (Mobile Forms & Data Collection)</h5>
						<p><strong>Focus:</strong> flexible, code-free form building, offline data capture, custom reporting.</p>
						<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Drag-and-drop form builder for checklists, inspections, audits</li>
							<li>Offline mode for remote or shielded industrial environments</li>
							<li>Easy export & integration with BI tools (Excel, Tableau, Power BI)</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>2. Putting Personas First</h4>
						<p>Each demo starts by defining who we're talking to and what pain they feel on a Monday morning:</p>
						
						<table>
							<tr>
								<th>Persona</th>
								<th>Top Pain Point</th>
								<th>Demo Focus</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Operations Manager</td>
								<td>Lack of real-time visibility into line performance</td>
								<td>Shiftconnector dashboards & alerts</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Maintenance Lead</td>
								<td>Unclear procedures & long repair times</td>
								<td>Augmentir's guided work instructions</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Quality Engineer</td>
								<td>Paper-based inspections & audit prep headaches</td>
								<td>GoCanvas mobile forms & report exports</td>
							</tr>
						</table>

						<h4>3. Demo Design Walk-through</h4>

						<h5>A. Shiftconnector Demo</h5>
						<p><strong>Persona:</strong> Operations Manager<br>
						<strong>Use Case:</strong> Bypass interlocks procedure at an ethanol plant</p>
						<p><strong>Key Features Shown:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Workflow Module:</strong> I configured a "Bypass Interlock" SOP that steps operators through each safety check, with digital sign-off at each stage.</li>
							<li><strong>Real-Time Dashboard:</strong> Simulated sensor data feeds into an OEE dashboard, highlighting how a single mis-step would trigger an alert.</li>
							<li><strong>Data Drill-Down:</strong> I demonstrate drilling from a high-level KPI down to the exact shift and operator who bypassed an interlock, showing traceability for compliance audits.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>B. Augmentir Demo</h5>
						<p><strong>Persona:</strong> Maintenance Lead<br>
						<strong>Use Case:</strong> Guided valve replacement on a packaging line</p>
						<p><strong>Key Features Shown:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Step-by-Step Guidance:</strong> I built a procedure with inline images and an AR overlay (simulated in the demo) that highlights the exact valve bolts to remove.</li>
							<li><strong>Skill-Routing Logic:</strong> The demo user logs in; Augmentir automatically assigns the task only if their profile has the required safety certification.</li>
								<li><strong>Feedback Capture:</strong> At the end, the user can record a quick voice note suggesting a tweak, which illustrates how continuous improvement gets fed back into the product team.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>C. GoCanvas Demo</h5>
						<p><strong>Persona:</strong> Quality Engineer<br>
						<strong>Use Case:</strong> Daily line inspection & audit reporting</p>
						<p><strong>Key Features Shown:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Form Builder:</strong> I show how to drag in a photo-capture field for "Cleanliness Check," a dropdown for "Pass/Fail," and a signature block for line manager approval.</li>
							<li><strong>Offline Submission:</strong> I simulate "no network" on the tablet and show offline data being queued, then automatically uploaded when connectivity returns.</li>
							<li><strong>Custom Reports:</strong> Finally, I export the week's inspection data into a Tableau-compatible CSV, demonstrating fast audit prep.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>4. Why This Approach Works</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Persona Empathy:</strong> By framing each session around a real user's daily struggles, prospects immediately see relevance.</li>
							<li><strong>Use Case Authenticity:</strong> I research industry best practices (for example, ethanol plant interlock standards and packaging line maintenance checklists) so the demo feels like real work, not a toy.</li>
							<li><strong>Feature Prioritization:</strong> Instead of overwhelming with every toggle and report, I showcase the three features each persona cares about most.</li>
							<li><strong>Interactive & Measurable:</strong> Prospects can click through steps themselves and see how easy it is to gather data, generate reports, or escalate issues, which builds confidence and speeds up decisions.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Conclusion</h4>
						<p>Crafting a demo system isn't just about "turn features on." It's about telling a story that mirrors a prospect's day, speaks their language, and shows exactly how the platform will transform their workflows. Whether it's a safety-critical SOP in Shiftconnector, an AR-enhanced procedure in Augmentir, or a mobile inspection app in GoCanvas, focusing on persona pain points and common industrial use cases ensures every demo session becomes a powerful selling moment.</p>

						<h3>MES Systems 101: What Developers Should Know</h3>
						<p class="blog-meta">August 2025</p>
						
						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>Manufacturing Execution Systems live at the critical junction between the shop floor and IT. They collect high frequency sensor data, enforce Standard Operating Procedures, and power real time dashboards for plant managers. Unlike typical web apps, MES has to handle precise timestamps, strict audit trails, and uneven network conditions. In this post, I break down the core components in plain English and then dive into three platforms I've worked with (Shiftconnector, AspenTech Inmation, and Augmentir) to share the engineering lessons every developer should know.</p>

						<h4>1. MES Core Components Explained</h4>

						<h5>A. Data Ingestion & Historian</h5>
							<p><strong>Role:</strong> Capture real time streams from PLCs, SCADA, and IoT sensors (often hundreds of tags per second) and store them in a time series database.</p>
						<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Precise, millisecond-aligned data is non-negotiable for troubleshooting, optimization, and regulatory compliance.</p>

						<h5>B. Workflow / Procedure Engine</h5>
							<p><strong>Role:</strong> Model SOPs as state machines. Operators cannot skip steps, and every action (with user ID and timestamp) is logged.</p>
						<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Regulated industries (pharma, energy, chemicals) require strict adherence to procedures—or face downtime, recalls, or fines.</p>

						<h5>C. Analytics & Dashboards</h5>
							<p><strong>Role:</strong> Transform raw events into KPIs such as OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), MTTR (Mean Time To Repair), batch yield, quality metrics, and more.</p>
						<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Plant managers need instant visibility into performance and quality to drive continuous improvement.</p>

						<h5>D. Integration & APIs</h5>
							<p><strong>Role:</strong> Offer REST, OPC UA, or proprietary connectors to ERP systems, historians (for example, PI and Inmation), BI tools (Power BI and Tableau), and custom clients.</p>
						<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> MES rarely stands alone; seamless data exchange with upstream and downstream systems is essential.</p>

						<h4>2. The Hidden Engineering Challenges</h4>
						
						<h5>High-Velocity Streams</h5>
						<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Treat sensor updates like HTTP requests.</p>
							<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Use event driven architectures (Kafka or RabbitMQ) or specialized time series databases to handle thousands of writes per second.</p>

						<h5>Time Synchronization</h5>
						<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Trust each device's local clock.</p>
							<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Implement NTP or PTP across PLCs and servers. Convert all timestamps to a single source of truth for accurate traceability.</p>

						<h5>Offline Resilience</h5>
						<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Assume constant connectivity.</p>
							<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Buffer events at the edge (browser or gateway) and retry submissions when the network returns to avoid data loss.</p>

						<h5>Regulatory Audit Trails</h5>
						<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Log only "success/failure."</p>
							<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Capture detailed metadata for every action, including operator ID, before and after values, code versions, and change reasons.</p>

						<h4>3. Platform Deep Dive</h4>

						<h5>3.1 Shiftconnector: Digital Collaboration & Workflow Enforcement</h5>
							<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> A shift handover and collaboration tool that replaces paper logs and siloed emails with structured workflows and searchable handover records.</p>
						<p><strong>Core Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Workflow Engine: Enforces SOPs as state machines so operators cannot skip or reorder steps.</li>
							<li>Real-Time Collaboration: Centralized feed for shift logs, incident reporting, and formal handovers.</li>
							<li>PLC/DCS Integration: Auto-trigger tasks or alerts when sensor thresholds are hit.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Developer Takeaways:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Pluggable Step Executors: Build a unified interface so each workflow step can call a human-confirmation handler or a PLC check with the same code path.</li>
							<li>Local Event Buffering: Edge-buffer workflow events in the browser or gateway; flush when connectivity resumes.</li>
							<li>Feature Toggles for Variants: Keep plant-specific SOP tweaks (e.g., "Bypass Interlock" rules) behind configuration flags instead of code forks.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>3.2 AspenTech Inmation: The Industrial Data Fabric</h5>
							<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> A scalable middleware that unifies real time tag data, historical archives, and relational batch records into a single, secure platform.</p>
						<p><strong>Core Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Unified Connectivity: Adapters for PLC/SCADA, OSIsoft PI, relational DBs, and more.</li>
							<li>Dual Storage Layers: Raw time series data in the TSDB and aggregated KPIs in relational tables.</li>
							<li>Distributed & Secure: Enterprise-grade scaling with fine-grained access controls.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Developer Takeaways:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Separate TSDB & OLTP: Never jam high-frequency writes into relational schemas—let the historian handle raw tags and use the relational layer for dashboards.</li>
							<li>Metadata-First Modeling: Tag each data point with unit, precision, and source to avoid consistency bugs.</li>
							<li>Simulator for Testing: Create a lightweight tag-value simulator to accelerate both demo setups and automated tests.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>3.3 Augmentir: AI-Powered Digital Workflows</h5>
							<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> A no code platform that transforms paper SOPs into interactive digital instructions, enhanced with AI and AR to guide frontline technicians.</p>
						<p><strong>Core Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Drag-and-Drop Workflow Builder: Define steps, checks, media, and decision logic without coding.</li>
							<li>AI Personalization: Machine-learning models recommend next best actions and identify procedural bottlenecks.</li>
							<li>Remote Expert & Feedback: Technicians can request live help or submit improvement suggestions in-app.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Developer Takeaways:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Micro-Frontend Steps: Build each workflow step as an independent component for easy reuse and testing.</li>
							<li>Instrument Everything: Log user interactions, time-to-complete, and decision paths so AI models have clean data to learn from.</li>
							<li>Offline-First UX: Cache workflows on the device and sync user logs when network connectivity returns.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>4. Best Practices & Wrap-Up</h4>

							<li>Event-Driven Architecture: Decouple ingestion from processing with message brokers to handle spikes gracefully.</li>
							<li>Metadata Discipline: Always include units, precision, source, and operator IDs on your data models.</li>
							<li>Pre-Production Simulators: Use synthetic data generators to build, test, and demo without a live plant.</li>
							<li>Modular Workflow Design: Treat each SOP step as a standalone plugin or micro-service to simplify maintenance and site-specific variations.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>MES platforms demand a specialized approach—real-time data handling, strict compliance, and unreliable networks. By applying these lessons from Shiftconnector, Inmation, and Augmentir, you'll build more resilient, auditable, and user-friendly systems that bridge engineering and operations effectively.</p>

						<h3>From Confusion to Clarity: Writing Docs That Developers Actually Use</h3>
						<p class="blog-meta">August 2025</p>
						<p class="blog-subtitle">How clear, purpose-driven documentation accelerates team productivity</p>

						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>We have all been there: a new tool lands in the stack, but the docs read like legal fine print or half finished bullet points. The result is frustrated developers, stalled projects, and endless "Do you know how this works?" Slack threads.</p>
						
						<p>Over the past two years, I've owned the documentation for platforms like Shiftconnector, Augmentir, and GoCanvas, covering onboarding guides, wikis, and SOPs for critical workflows. I also hosted admin and key user trainings to help teams get the most out of these tools. In this post, I share the principles and practices that turned our docs from a clogged knowledge pipeline into something that actually speeds teams up.</p>

						<h4>1. Start with Your Audience: Personas, Not Features</h4>
						<h5>Who is reading?</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>New Admins need a gentle ramp-up: account setup, permissions, high-level architecture.</li>
							<li>Key Users (Ops, Maintenance, Quality) want task-specific quick wins: "How do I trigger an AR overlay?" or "Where do I find audit logs?"</li>
							<li>Developers & Integrators crave API examples, payload schemas, and sample scripts.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="callout">
							<strong>Actionable tip:</strong> Start each guide with a simple line like "This doc is for new admins setting up roles for the first time." It sets expectations up front.
						</div>

						<h4>2. Organize by Task, Not by Menu</h4>
						
						<h5>The Pitfall of Menu-Driven Docs</h5>
						<p>Listing every dropdown and checkbox in the UI might feel thorough, but it is overwhelming. Users care about outcomes, not menus.</p>

						<h5>Task-Centered Structure</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Onboarding Guide:</strong>
								<ol>
									<li>Create your first admin user</li>
									<li>Configure user roles</li>
									<li>Connect your first data source</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Deployment Doc:</strong>
								<ol>
									<li>Install prerequisites (VM, Docker, dependencies)</li>
									<li>Run the setup script</li>
									<li>Verify connectivity and run smoke tests</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>SOP Walk-Through (Shiftconnector Bypass Interlocks):</strong>
								<ol>
									<li>Navigate to the Workflow module</li>
									<li>Select the "Bypass Interlocks" process</li>
									<li>Complete each safety confirmation step</li>
									<li>Review the generated audit log for compliance</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>By anchoring each section around a real goal, your reader can dive straight into action without hunting for the right fragment.</p>

						<h4>3. Real-Life Example: Bypass Interlocks at an Ethanol Plant</h4>
						<p>At one ethanol facility I support, safety interlocks require manual verification during certain maintenance windows. I developed an SOP document that walks operators through:</p>

						<ol>
							<li><strong>Launching the Workflow:</strong> A step-by-step screenshot tour of the "Bypass Interlocks" workflow in Shiftconnector.</li>
							<li><strong>Performing Safety Checks:</strong> Clear instructions (with callouts) on verifying valve positions and recording sensor readings.</li>
							<li><strong>Digital Sign-Off:</strong> How to capture operator ID and timestamp each approval.</li>
							<li><strong>Audit Review:</strong> Locating the final audit log entry and exporting it for regulatory reporting.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>Because the guide is task focused and clearly annotated, new shift leads can complete the bypass safely in under 5 minutes, down from 20 minutes of ad hoc email exchanges and paper logs.</p>

						<h4>4. Use Visuals and Code Side-by-Side</h4>

						<h5>Why it works</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Screenshots with Callouts bridge the gap between description and click-practice.</li>
							<li>Code snippets paired with sample API requests let developers copy-paste and experiment immediately.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="code-example">
							<p><strong>Example for Developers</strong></p>
							<pre><code>// Trigger "Bypass Interlocks" workflow via API
POST /api/workflows/start
{
    "workflowId": "bypass_interlocks_etoh",
    "operatorId": "user_123",
    "parameters": {
        "plant": "EthanolPlantA",
        "step": "safety_check_complete"
    }
}</code></pre>
							<p>Next to it: a screenshot highlighting the "Start Workflow" button and the JSON payload fields in Shiftconnector's UI. Instant clarity, zero guesswork.</p>
						</div>

						<h4>5. Create Living Docs with Version Control</h4>

						<h5>The Challenge</h5>
						<p>Static PDFs or wiki pages age quickly, especially in fast moving environments where new features roll out weekly.</p>

						<h5>The Solution</h5>
						<ul>
						<li><strong>Doc as code:</strong> Maintain markdown files in Git with the same PR and review process as your code.</li>
						<li><strong>Changelog front and center:</strong> Add a "What changed" section at the top of each guide so returning readers can see updates quickly.</li>
						<li><strong>Automated publishing:</strong> Hook your docs repo into a static site generator like Docusaurus for instant updates.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>6. Measure and Iterate</h4>

						<h5>Metrics that matter</h5>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Time to First Success:</strong> How long does it take a new admin to complete initial setup?</li>
							<li><strong>Support Ticket Volume:</strong> Which doc pages correlate with spikes in help requests?</li>
							<li><strong>Wiki Page Views & Search Queries:</strong> Identify dead-ends or highly trafficked topics.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Feedback Loops</h5>
						<p>Embed quick feedback widgets or run short post-training surveys to uncover friction points. Then iterate documentation in your next sprint.</p>

						<h4>Conclusion</h4>
						<p>Great documentation is not an afterthought. It connects your product to the people who use it. By writing for specific personas, organizing around tasks, including real examples like bypass interlocks in Shiftconnector, using visuals and living docs, and measuring impact, you turn confusion into clarity.</p>
						
						<p>Whether you're rolling out a new workflow or building an API integration, invest in docs that developers actually use, and your team will move faster.</p>
