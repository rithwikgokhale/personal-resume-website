						<h3>Building Persona-Driven Demo Systems for Industrial Platforms</h3>
						<p class="blog-meta">August 2025</p>
						
						<p>When you're trying to sell a complex industrial platform—whether it's a Manufacturing Execution System (MES), a digital workflow engine, or a mobile forms app—the real magic happens when you step into your buyer's shoes. Over the past year at Adatafy, I've built demo environments for three different platforms—Shiftconnector, Augmentir, and GoCanvas—that our sales team now uses every week to win new clients. Here's how I approached each one from the perspective of key personas, the core features I highlighted, and why those demos resonate in day-to-day operations.</p>

						<h4>1. Understanding Each Platform's Strengths</h4>

						<h5>Shiftconnector (MES System)</h5>
						<p><strong>Focus:</strong> real-time shop-floor visibility, automated workflows, data capture for compliance.</p>
						<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Workflow module that enforces standard operating procedures (SOPs)</li>
							<li>Real-time dashboards for OEE, quality, and throughput metrics</li>
							<li>Integration with PLCs and sensors for automated data ingestion</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Augmentir (Digital Workflows + Guided Procedures)</h5>
						<p><strong>Focus:</strong> guided work instructions, skill-based routing, remote assistance.</p>
						<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Step-by-step guided procedures with embedded videos and AR annotations</li>
							<li>Skill-based work assignment that routes tasks to qualified technicians</li>
							<li>Built-in feedback loops to capture field-level improvement suggestions</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>GoCanvas (Mobile Forms & Data Collection)</h5>
						<p><strong>Focus:</strong> flexible, code-free form building, offline data capture, custom reporting.</p>
						<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Drag-and-drop form builder for checklists, inspections, audits</li>
							<li>Offline mode for remote or shielded industrial environments</li>
							<li>Easy export & integration with BI tools (Excel, Tableau, Power BI)</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>2. Putting Personas First</h4>
						<p>Each demo starts by defining who we're talking to—and what pain they feel on a Monday morning:</p>
						
						<table>
							<tr>
								<th>Persona</th>
								<th>Top Pain Point</th>
								<th>Demo Focus</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Operations Manager</td>
								<td>Lack of real-time visibility into line performance</td>
								<td>Shiftconnector dashboards & alerts</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Maintenance Lead</td>
								<td>Unclear procedures & long repair times</td>
								<td>Augmentir's guided work instructions</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Quality Engineer</td>
								<td>Paper-based inspections & audit prep headaches</td>
								<td>GoCanvas mobile forms & report exports</td>
							</tr>
						</table>

						<h4>3. Demo Design Walk-through</h4>

						<h5>A. Shiftconnector Demo</h5>
						<p><strong>Persona:</strong> Operations Manager<br>
						<strong>Use Case:</strong> Bypass interlocks procedure at an ethanol plant</p>
						<p><strong>Key Features Shown:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Workflow Module:</strong> I configured a "Bypass Interlock" SOP that steps operators through each safety check, with digital sign-off at each stage.</li>
							<li><strong>Real-Time Dashboard:</strong> Simulated sensor data feeds into an OEE dashboard, highlighting how a single mis-step would trigger an alert.</li>
							<li><strong>Data Drill-Down:</strong> I demonstrate drilling from a high-level KPI down to the exact shift and operator who bypassed an interlock, showing traceability for compliance audits.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>B. Augmentir Demo</h5>
						<p><strong>Persona:</strong> Maintenance Lead<br>
						<strong>Use Case:</strong> Guided valve replacement on a packaging line</p>
						<p><strong>Key Features Shown:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Step-by-Step Guidance:</strong> I built a procedure with inline images and an AR overlay (simulated in the demo) that highlights the exact valve bolts to remove.</li>
							<li><strong>Skill-Routing Logic:</strong> The demo user logs in; Augmentir automatically assigns the task only if their profile has the required safety certification.</li>
							<li><strong>Feedback Capture:</strong> At the end, the user can record a quick voice note suggesting a tweak—illustrating how continuous improvement gets fed back into the product team.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>C. GoCanvas Demo</h5>
						<p><strong>Persona:</strong> Quality Engineer<br>
						<strong>Use Case:</strong> Daily line inspection & audit reporting</p>
						<p><strong>Key Features Shown:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Form Builder:</strong> I show how to drag in a photo-capture field for "Cleanliness Check," a dropdown for "Pass/Fail," and a signature block for line manager approval.</li>
							<li><strong>Offline Submission:</strong> I simulate "no network" on the tablet and show offline data being queued, then automatically uploaded when connectivity returns.</li>
							<li><strong>Custom Reports:</strong> Finally, I export the week's inspection data into a Tableau-compatible CSV, demonstrating fast audit prep.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>4. Why This Approach Works</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Persona Empathy:</strong> By framing each session around a real user's daily struggles, prospects immediately see relevance.</li>
							<li><strong>Use Case Authenticity:</strong> I research industry best practices—e.g., ethanol-plant interlock standards, packaging-line maintenance checklists—so the demo feels like "real work," not a toy.</li>
							<li><strong>Feature Prioritization:</strong> Instead of overwhelming with every toggle and report, I showcase the three features each persona cares about most.</li>
							<li><strong>Interactive & Measurable:</strong> Prospects can click through steps themselves and see how easy it is to gather data, generate reports, or escalate issues—building confidence and speeding decision-making.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Conclusion</h4>
						<p>Crafting a demo system isn't just about "turn features on." It's about telling a story that mirrors a prospect's day, speaks their language, and shows exactly how the platform will transform their workflows. Whether it's a safety-critical SOP in Shiftconnector, an AR-enhanced procedure in Augmentir, or a mobile inspection app in GoCanvas, focusing on persona pain points and common industrial use cases ensures every demo session becomes a powerful selling moment.</p>

						<h3>MES Systems 101: What Developers Should Know</h3>
						<p class="blog-meta">August 2025</p>
						
						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) live at the critical junction between the shop floor and IT: collecting high-frequency sensor data, enforcing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and feeding real-time dashboards for plant managers. Unlike typical web apps, MES must juggle millisecond-accurate timestamps, strict audit trails, and spotty network conditions. In this post, we'll break down the core MES components in plain English—and then dive into three platforms I've worked with (Shiftconnector, AspenTech Inmation & Augmentir) to surface the hidden engineering lessons every developer should know.</p>

						<h4>1. MES Core Components Explained</h4>

						<h5>A. Data Ingestion & Historian</h5>
						<p><strong>Role:</strong> Capture real-time streams from PLCs, SCADA, and IoT sensors—often hundreds of tags per second—and store them in a time-series database (TSDB).</p>
						<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Precise, millisecond-aligned data is non-negotiable for troubleshooting, optimization, and regulatory compliance.</p>

						<h5>B. Workflow / Procedure Engine</h5>
						<p><strong>Role:</strong> Model SOPs as state machines. Operators can't skip steps, and every action (with user ID and timestamp) is logged.</p>
						<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Regulated industries (pharma, energy, chemicals) require strict adherence to procedures—or face downtime, recalls, or fines.</p>

						<h5>C. Analytics & Dashboards</h5>
						<p><strong>Role:</strong> Transform raw events into KPIs—OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), MTTR (Mean Time To Repair), batch yield, quality metrics, and more.</p>
						<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Plant managers need instant visibility into performance and quality to drive continuous improvement.</p>

						<h5>D. Integration & APIs</h5>
						<p><strong>Role:</strong> Offer RESTful, OPC-UA, or proprietary connectors to ERP systems, historians (e.g. PI, Inmation), BI tools (Power BI, Tableau), and custom clients.</p>
						<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> MES rarely stands alone; seamless data exchange with upstream and downstream systems is essential.</p>

						<h4>2. The Hidden Engineering Challenges</h4>
						
						<h5>High-Velocity Streams</h5>
						<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Treat sensor updates like HTTP requests.</p>
						<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Use event-driven architectures (Kafka, RabbitMQ) or specialized TSDBs to handle thousands of writes per second.</p>

						<h5>Time Synchronization</h5>
						<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Trust each device's local clock.</p>
						<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Implement NTP/PTP across PLCs and servers. Convert all timestamps to a single source of truth for accurate traceability.</p>

						<h5>Offline Resilience</h5>
						<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Assume constant connectivity.</p>
						<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Buffer events at the edge (browser, gateway) and retry submissions when the network returns, ensuring no data loss.</p>

						<h5>Regulatory Audit Trails</h5>
						<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Log only "success/failure."</p>
						<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Capture detailed metadata—operator ID, before/after values, code versions, and change reasons—for every action.</p>

						<h4>3. Platform Deep Dive</h4>

						<h5>3.1 Shiftconnector: Digital Collaboration & Workflow Enforcement</h5>
						<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> A shift-handover and collaboration tool that replaces paper logs and siloed emails with structured workflows and searchable handover records.</p>
						<p><strong>Core Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Workflow Engine: Enforces SOPs as state machines—operators can't skip or reorder steps.</li>
							<li>Real-Time Collaboration: Centralized feed for shift logs, incident reporting, and formal handovers.</li>
							<li>PLC/DCS Integration: Auto-trigger tasks or alerts when sensor thresholds are hit.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Developer Takeaways:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Pluggable Step Executors: Build a unified interface so each workflow step can call a human-confirmation handler or a PLC check with the same code path.</li>
							<li>Local Event Buffering: Edge-buffer workflow events in the browser or gateway; flush when connectivity resumes.</li>
							<li>Feature Toggles for Variants: Keep plant-specific SOP tweaks (e.g., "Bypass Interlock" rules) behind configuration flags instead of code forks.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>3.2 AspenTech Inmation: The Industrial Data Fabric</h5>
						<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> A scalable middleware that unifies real-time tag data, historical archives, and relational batch records into a single, secure platform.</p>
						<p><strong>Core Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Unified Connectivity: Adapters for PLC/SCADA, OSIsoft PI, relational DBs, and more.</li>
							<li>Dual Storage Layers: Raw time-series data in the TSDB; aggregated KPIs in relational tables.</li>
							<li>Distributed & Secure: Enterprise-grade scaling with fine-grained access controls.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Developer Takeaways:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Separate TSDB & OLTP: Never jam high-frequency writes into relational schemas—let the historian handle raw tags and use the relational layer for dashboards.</li>
							<li>Metadata-First Modeling: Tag each data point with unit, precision, and source to avoid consistency bugs.</li>
							<li>Simulator for Testing: Create a lightweight tag-value simulator to accelerate both demo setups and automated tests.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>3.3 Augmentir: AI-Powered Digital Workflows</h5>
						<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> A no-code platform that transforms paper SOPs into interactive digital instructions, enhanced with AI and AR to guide frontline technicians.</p>
						<p><strong>Core Strengths:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Drag-and-Drop Workflow Builder: Define steps, checks, media, and decision logic without coding.</li>
							<li>AI Personalization: Machine-learning models recommend next best actions and identify procedural bottlenecks.</li>
							<li>Remote Expert & Feedback: Technicians can request live help or submit improvement suggestions in-app.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Developer Takeaways:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Micro-Frontend Steps: Build each workflow step as an independent component for easy reuse and testing.</li>
							<li>Instrument Everything: Log user interactions, time-to-complete, and decision paths so AI models have clean data to learn from.</li>
							<li>Offline-First UX: Cache workflows on the device and sync user logs when network connectivity returns.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>4. Best Practices & Wrap-Up</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Event-Driven Architecture: Decouple ingestion from processing with message brokers to handle spikes gracefully.</li>
							<li>Metadata Discipline: Always include units, precision, source, and operator IDs on your data models.</li>
							<li>Pre-Production Simulators: Use synthetic data generators to build, test, and demo without a live plant.</li>
							<li>Modular Workflow Design: Treat each SOP step as a standalone plugin or micro-service to simplify maintenance and site-specific variations.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>MES platforms demand a specialized approach—real-time data handling, strict compliance, and unreliable networks. By applying these lessons from Shiftconnector, Inmation, and Augmentir, you'll build more resilient, auditable, and user-friendly systems that bridge engineering and operations effectively.</p>

						<h3>From Confusion to Clarity: Writing Docs That Developers Actually Use</h3>
						<p class="blog-meta">August 2025</p>
						<p class="blog-subtitle">How clear, purpose-driven documentation accelerates team productivity</p>

						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>We've all been there: a new tool lands in our stack, but the docs read like dense legalese or half-finished bullet points. The result? Frustrated developers, stalled projects, and endless "Do you know how this works?" Slack threads.</p>
						
						<p>Over the past two years, I've owned the documentation for platforms like Shiftconnector, Augmentir, and GoCanvas—everything from onboarding guides and wikis to SOPs for critical workflows. I've hosted admin and key-user trainings to ensure teams get maximum ROI from these tools. In this post, I'll share the principles and practices that turned our docs from a clogged knowledge pipeline into an engine for speed and confidence.</p>

						<h4>1. Start with Your Audience: Personas, Not Features</h4>
						<h5>Who's Reading?</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>New Admins need a gentle ramp-up: account setup, permissions, high-level architecture.</li>
							<li>Key Users (Ops, Maintenance, Quality) want task-specific quick wins: "How do I trigger an AR overlay?" or "Where do I find audit logs?"</li>
							<li>Developers & Integrators crave API examples, payload schemas, and sample scripts.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="callout">
							<strong>Actionable Tip:</strong> Kick off each guide with a one-sentence "This doc is for…" line. It cuts confusion and sets expectations up front.
						</div>

						<h4>2. Organize by Task, Not by Menu</h4>
						
						<h5>The Pitfall of Menu-Driven Docs</h5>
						<p>Listing every dropdown and checkbox in the UI might feel thorough, but it's overwhelming. Users don't care about menus—they care about outcomes.</p>

						<h5>Task-Centered Structure</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Onboarding Guide:</strong>
								<ol>
									<li>Create your first admin user</li>
									<li>Configure user roles</li>
									<li>Connect your first data source</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Deployment Doc:</strong>
								<ol>
									<li>Install prerequisites (VM, Docker, dependencies)</li>
									<li>Run the setup script</li>
									<li>Verify connectivity and run smoke tests</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>SOP Walk-Through (Shiftconnector Bypass Interlocks):</strong>
								<ol>
									<li>Navigate to the Workflow module</li>
									<li>Select the "Bypass Interlocks" process</li>
									<li>Complete each safety confirmation step</li>
									<li>Review the generated audit log for compliance</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>By anchoring each section around a real goal, your reader dives straight into action without hunting for the right fragment.</p>

						<h4>3. Real-Life Example: Bypass Interlocks at an Ethanol Plant</h4>
						<p>At one ethanol facility I support, safety interlocks require manual verification during certain maintenance windows. I developed an SOP document that walks operators through:</p>

						<ol>
							<li><strong>Launching the Workflow:</strong> A step-by-step screenshot tour of the "Bypass Interlocks" workflow in Shiftconnector.</li>
							<li><strong>Performing Safety Checks:</strong> Clear instructions (with callouts) on verifying valve positions and recording sensor readings.</li>
							<li><strong>Digital Sign-Off:</strong> How to capture operator ID and timestamp each approval.</li>
							<li><strong>Audit Review:</strong> Locating the final audit log entry and exporting it for regulatory reporting.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>Because the guide is task-focused and richly annotated, new shift leads can complete the bypass safely in under 5 minutes—down from 20 minutes of ad-hoc email exchanges and paper logs.</p>

						<h4>4. Use Visuals and Code Side-by-Side</h4>

						<h5>Why It Works</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Screenshots with Callouts bridge the gap between description and click-practice.</li>
							<li>Code snippets paired with sample API requests let developers copy-paste and experiment immediately.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="code-example">
							<p><strong>Example for Developers</strong></p>
							<pre><code>// Trigger "Bypass Interlocks" workflow via API
POST /api/workflows/start
{
    "workflowId": "bypass_interlocks_etoh",
    "operatorId": "user_123",
    "parameters": {
        "plant": "EthanolPlantA",
        "step": "safety_check_complete"
    }
}</code></pre>
							<p>Next to it: a screenshot highlighting the "Start Workflow" button and the JSON payload fields in Shiftconnector's UI. Instant clarity, zero guesswork.</p>
						</div>

						<h4>5. Create Living Docs with Version Control</h4>

						<h5>The Challenge</h5>
						<p>Static PDFs or wiki pages age quickly—especially in fast-moving environments where new features roll out weekly.</p>

						<h5>The Solution</h5>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Doc-as-Code:</strong> Maintain markdown files in Git—same PR/review process as your code.</li>
							<li><strong>Changelog Front and Center:</strong> At the top of each guide, include "What's Changed" so returning readers know what's new.</li>
							<li><strong>Automated Publishing:</strong> Hook your docs repo into a static site generator (like Docusaurus) for instant updates.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>6. Measure and Iterate</h4>

						<h5>Metrics That Matter</h5>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Time to First Success:</strong> How long does it take a new admin to complete initial setup?</li>
							<li><strong>Support Ticket Volume:</strong> Which doc pages correlate with spikes in help requests?</li>
							<li><strong>Wiki Page Views & Search Queries:</strong> Identify dead-ends or highly trafficked topics.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Feedback Loops</h5>
						<p>Embed quick feedback widgets or run short post-training surveys to uncover friction points. Then iterate documentation in your next sprint.</p>

						<h4>Conclusion</h4>
						<p>Great documentation isn't an afterthought—it's the superhighway connecting your product to the people who use it. By writing for specific personas, organizing around tasks, surfacing real-world examples like bypass interlocks in Shiftconnector, using visuals and living docs, and measuring impact, you transform confusion into clarity.</p>
						
						<p>Whether you're rolling out a new workflow or building an API integration, invest in docs developers actually use—and watch your team accelerate beyond what you thought possible.</p>
